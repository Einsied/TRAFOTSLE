Space game:
* dynasties for Monarchies
* chronicles (ahnenreihen bonus fÃ¼r current ruler)
* ruling parties
* party leaders for republics
* assassination and stuff like that
* species life expectancy 25-300 years after that biological immortality
* name list for titles so all monarchs can be named after roman emperors and all spiritual leaders after soft drinks or so (player can choose those and the  are cosmetic)(they track incarnation so we get Pepsi III. (space pope) automatically)

Player looses control if dynasties or leader and ruling party are switched or so. => allows takeover of empires from within

Multiple leaders like:
* spiritual
* monarch
* prime minister etc.
For more flavor and fluent change between systems (monarchy, constitutional monarchy, republic)
