To allow heroes to exist on the battlefield as classical hero units.
It should be possible to bind characters to specific units.
So  a captain can be bound to a ship or a warrior to a special warrior unit.

It could also be interesting to do this the other way round.
But there are already some thoughts about unit loyalty in writing,
I suppose.
