# System
The Notes come from two sources:
* The handwritten notes
* A small txt

The handwritten notes are catalogued and digitalized 
and will be kept as a backup.

The notes will be transformed into particles spawned from the sources,
that are then connected to topics.

From this topics a implementation plan will be written and later implemented.
This implementation plan should be the precursor to a documentation,
because it describes what should be possible.

## Sanity Checks
* each Note should have at least one particle
* each particle should be part of one topic

## Naming conventions

I stands for physical documents/source notes
D for digital documents/source notes
P stands for particles
T stands for topics
