# System
The Notes come from two sources:
* The handwritten notes
* A small txt

The handwritten notes are catalogued and digitalized 
and will be kept as a backup.

The notes will be transformed into particles spawned from the sources,
that are then connected to topics.

Concepts are collection of particles that will later morph into classes.
They collect information like topics but are restricted to an entity.
They also contain additional description text.

From this topics a implementation plan will be written and later implemented.
This implementation plan should be the precursor to a documentation,
because it describes what should be possible.

## Sanity Checks
* each Note should have at least one particle
* each particle should be part of one topic

## Naming conventions

I stands for physical documents/source notes
D for digital documents/source notes
P stands for particles
C stand for concept
T stands for topics
