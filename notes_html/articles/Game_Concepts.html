				<h2> Description </h2>
				<section>
					<a name="Fleets">
						<h3> Fleets </h3>
					</a>
					<p>
						Ships should be collected in entities
						like fleets and strike forces to allow easier
						management. (Same could be done to armies)
						<a href="../articles/Object_Hierarchy.html">
							(See also Object Hierarchy#Fleets)
						</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Fleets should be lead by characters like officers.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<a name="Military_Presence">
						<h3> Military Presence </h3>
					</a>
					<p>
						Every Ship and ground unit should create military
						pressure depending on its strength around it.
						This value will decline over time and distance to
						act as a hint to the AI and encourage arms races,
						by increasing the demand for military presence
						by the pops on other empires. 
						(Basically hostile pressure has to be counter by
						own culture pressure)
						(The effect on pops should differ depending on
						species and politics, so xenophobe warriors
						demand more military than peaceful xenophiles)
					</p>

					<a name="Turns">
						<h3> Turns </h3>
					</a>
					<p>
						Splitting turns in long and short terms allows for a
						better game pacing (Buildings being built every n minor
						turns while fleets move every turn)
						This allows to make bigger decisions later and take
						some of the decision work form the player.
						(Of course this should be optional)
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<a name="Points">
						<h3> Points </h3>
					</a>
					<p>
						As tribute to Civilization 3, I intend to introduce a
						point score.
						Points are earned by achieving self set objectives like:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Expanding the fleet
							</li>
							<li>
								Expanding territory
							</li>
							<li>
								Protecting sentient species
							</li>
							<li>
								Eliminate sentient species
							</li>
							<li>
								Build palaces or monuments
							</li>
							<li>
								Keep population happy
							</li>
							<li>
								Launch out of map invasion or colonization
								(extragalactic or extradimensional,
								which also act as resource drains)
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<a name="Politics">
						<h3> Politics </h3>
					</a>
					<p>
						Politics is tied to binary values (e.g. pacifism vs 
						Militarism).
						This enables every entity (party, pop, character) to
						have its opinion tracked by a array of integers.
						For pops it might be better if they have only on opinion
						and only if they are fanatic to keep the number of
						pops down. (Depending on what needs more space.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Parties could pick from this values and align them self
						along a set of them to attract voters.
						The pops would now also need a weight attached to the
						so they can pick issues important for them
						or I need to track the importance by splitting the values
						into two integers.
					</p>
					<a name="Conflicts">
						<h3> Conflicts </h3>
					</a>
					<p>
						Conflicts are vehicles for diplomatic tension
						(e.g. trade wars, cold wars, conventional wars).
						They always have at least one goal that somebody wishes
						to achieve (e.g. get control of a planet, subjugate
						another empire-entity, get the monopoly over a resource,
						get a certain tech, etc.).
						It should be possible to replace goals with similar
						goals (like get a claim on a planet with get a claim
						on the planet and its moon).
					</p>
					<p>
						Everybody can enter the conflict for a fee depending
						on the situation (e.g. rivalry, competing claims etc.),
						except the target of a goal that is drawn in for free.
						This fee is paid in an adequate currency 
						(e.g. diplomatic points, intelligence points, military
						pressure etc.) depending on the state and kind of the
						conflict.
						(Somebody else can also pay a fee to drag a party in).
					</p>
					<p>
						The conflict has an escalation level, or array
						allowing a civilized debate to glide into total war.
						This level is influenced by deliberate spending of the
						conflicts participants and by their actions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also additional values like public opinion could be
						added,
						allowing different ways to end a conflict,
						like one party having to bow to public opinion.
					</p>
					<p>
						Conflicts should be tree structures allowing them to
						accumulate into bigger conflicts or branch of into
						smaller ones.
						So a trade war that also contains a small scale war
						between minor 2 participants.
