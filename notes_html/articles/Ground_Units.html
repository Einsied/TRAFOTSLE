					<h3> Army composition </h3>
					<p>
						Armies are the "ground units" or the pseudo-atomic
						pieces in a ground battle.
						(It might be better to scrap them and deploy only units
						nut they might prove a neat abstraction for less deep
						planetary ground combat).
						They consist of different units mixed together.
						They could get a combined arms bonus during deployment
						to encourage mixing instead of spamming one unit.
						The idea is that the weakness of the unit count less
						than its strengths.
						So mixing anti-Tank infantry and anti-infantry tanks
						50:50,
						results in more damage to tanks than half the added
						values if the units.
					</p>

				<section>
					<h3> Sea </h3>
					<p>
						Considering water should be a factor in ground combat,
						(to offer the option to do battle on ocean worlds or
						just the pacific), dive gear for units might be
						interesting.
						Of course the should also be ships even if they might
						be used primarily as garrison units.
						(This also gives the option of stuff like torpedo
						bombers and submarines, that do not suffer damage
						from aircraft)
