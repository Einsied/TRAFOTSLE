					<h3> Galactic Regions </h3>
					<p>
						Galactic Regions should are used to give the map some
						larger scale texture.
						For example regions could be rich in nebulae,
						certain minerals, indigenous lifeforms or more or 
						less difficult to traverse.
						In general every region should have one or multiple
						themes to generate a more heterogeneous map.
						This themes might include player spawn themes like
						"the lonely empire" or "the sector of 3 powers".
						Balancing this themes could be difficult, but i believe
						they will be worth it.

					<h3> Setup Game </h3>
					<p>
						To allow a realistic formation for ancient empires
						a setup game is played within abstract systems
						(or regions if systems are to small).
						Different perks allow an earlier or later start.
						This a extremely simplified version of the game,
						where interaction is limited to stuff like:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Invest in the military
							</li>
							<li>
								Invest in research
							</li>
							<li>
								Colonies a system
							</li>
							<li>
								Invest in a colonized system
							</li>
							<li>
								Wage war
							</li>
							<li>
								Enforce peace
							</li>
							<li>
								Map distant regions
							</li>
							<li>
								up lift primitives
							</li>
							<li>
								strengthen the government
							</li>
							<li>
								Invest in the intelligence service
							</li>
							<li>
								Colonize with sub light ships (leading to 
								offshoot empires instead of directly 
								controlled area)
							</li>
							<li>
								etc.
							</li>
						</ul>
						A turn should be limited to n actions and the mini
						game should at least track colony development
						and some sort of fleet capacity to avoid spamming
						one action and getting ridiculous like an insane
						navy without any territory.
